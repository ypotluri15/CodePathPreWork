A simple swift app used to calculate tips on balance totals. By default, the
calculator displays tip amounts for the following percentages: 18%, 20%, 22%.
However, as an extra, feature I added the ability to set a default custom tip
amount that persists across sessions. Also, I completed a couple of the optional
features. Namely, local currency support and thousands separators; as well as
dark-theme support.

Overall, this project took me ~3 hours to complete.

**Required stories completed:**
- Base project and functionality
- Improved UI

**Optional stories completed:**
- Local currency and thousands separators
- Dark Theme

**Additional stories:**
- Default custom tip amount
